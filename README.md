# rps
This is my work to create a RPS (Rock, Paper, Scissors) game with JavaScript in the console. 

Work log: 

- On 1/19/22 I finished the game to where it plays 5 rounds and decalres a winner. Pretty basic, but pushing to GitHub and moving on to the next TOP lesson. iirc, I'll be coming back to the project after some more lessons. ttyl...

- On 2/6/22 TOP has me coming back to the game to add a new feature (UI) in a branch, then merge it with main. 

-- On 2/19/22 I came back to convert my console logging to a real UI by printing the results to the HTML page.
